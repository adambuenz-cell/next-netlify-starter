            <p>
             AI Fatigue is a pervasive and costly issue, with many professionals experiencing its effects daily. Workplace
              AI fatigue contributes to decreased cognitive and physical performance, reduced productivity due to errors and
              burnout, diminished job satisfaction, and increased incidents of fatigue-related accidents. These impacts
              often extend beyond the workplace, disrupting overall well-being and personal lives. To address workplace
              AI fatigue, strategies such as organizational adjustments, individual AI fatigue management training, and
              technology-driven interventions have been explored. Individual approaches, such as structured breaks,
              mindfulness exercises, and physical activity, have proven effective in mitigating AI fatigue and improving
              overall outcomes. However, these methods are often difficult to integrate into daily workflows, leading to
              inconsistent use and limited long-term benefits.

            <h2>Case Study</h2>
            <p>
AI fatigue management systems offer a promising solution. By dynamically adapting to user needs and detecting fatigue in real time, these systems can deliver timely, personalized interventions. This approach not only enhances engagement but also addresses the barriers of traditional methods, providing a seamless way to support focus, energy, and well-being throughout the workday. Integrating individual fatigue management interventions into the workday can be challenging, particularly in workplace cultures with high task demands or environments where taking personal time for recovery is not supported. Even in supportive workplaces, the shift from understanding effective fatigue management strategies to applying them during moments of peak fatigue can be difficult, requiring both psychological readiness and actionable opportunities.
AI-powered solutions, such as fatigue management apps and systems, have gained popularity due to their accessibility and unobtrusive nature. These tools allow users to engage with interventions seamlessly, without disrupting their work environment or drawing attention. However, many available apps lack evidence-based designs, and even those that are rigorously studied face challenges with user attrition and inconsistent engagement. Promoting sustained interaction with fatigue-reduction tools over time is critical to achieving long-term benefits. AI-driven systems designed to adapt to individual needs in real time offer a promising path forward, addressing barriers to adherence while improving outcomes. By focusing on dynamic engagement and user-specific customization, such systems can enhance both the effectiveness and adoption of technology-delivered interventions.

Integrating AI fatigue management strategies into daily workflows presents unique challenges, particularly in high-demand workplaces or cultures that do not prioritize time for recovery. Even in supportive environments, leveraging AI tools to address moments of peak mental or physical fatigue requires seamless integration, psychological readiness, and effective timing. AI-powered fatigue management systems are gaining traction as practical solutions due to their ability to adapt in real time and integrate unobtrusively into work environments. These systems can monitor user behavior and deliver tailored interventions to mitigate fatigue without disrupting productivity. Despite their potential, many existing solutions struggle with issues such as inconsistent engagement, user attrition, and limited evidence-based design.
</p>
<p>
Sustained interaction with AI fatigue management tools is crucial for long-term effectiveness. Systems that dynamically respond to individual needs and work conditions offer a promising approach. By emphasizing adaptive delivery, real-time feedback, and personalization, AI-driven platforms can tackle fatigue proactively, ensuring consistent engagement and improved workplace well-being. In this study, we present a four-week, between-subjects study with 74 AI specialists to examine the impact of digital micro-intervention timing and content on usage patterns and AI fatigue mitigation throughout the workday. Our goal was to inform the design of effective and engaging fatigue management systems. Using a desktop application for passive data collection and a Teams chatbot for intervention delivery, we tested three categories of intervention content across two timing conditions: User-Scheduled (US) and Adaptive Delivery (AD), where the system dynamically adjusted based on passively-sensed and user-reported fatigue levels.
</p>
<p>
Our results showed that interventions significantly alleviated momentary fatigue. While no significant differences were observed between AD and US conditions in long-term or momentary fatigue reduction, participants expressed a preference for automated "nudges" over self-scheduling interventions. At the same time, they desired a level of control over their schedules, with system assistance for intelligent planning. Participants rated shorter, simpler interventions as more enjoyable, yet longer, more challenging interventions proved to be significantly more effective in reducing fatigue.
</p>
<p>
These findings suggest that both system-initiated delivery and user-initiated scheduling are valuable approaches for integrating fatigue management interventions in the workplace. A combination of the two may be optimal: system-initiated interventions provide convenience and boost overall engagement, while user-initiated scheduling promotes a sense of control and supports healthy behavior changes. Additionally, a balance between easy-to-perform and highly effective interventions appears to benefit users the most. Based on these insights, we propose opportunities to guide the development of personalized, adaptive fatigue management systems that improve workplace well-being.
</p>
<p>

Intervention strategies for managing AI fatigue in the workplace can be grouped into three categories: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary strategies focus on altering or eliminating the underlying causes of AI fatigue. These might include changes at the organizational level, such as adjusting workflows or adopting new tools to reduce the reliance on AI systems. While these strategies can have a significant long-term impact, they are often difficult to implement or measure due to their high cost and potential disruption to existing operations.
</p>
<p>

Secondary strategies, which are the most common, focus on the individual’s experience with AI fatigue and aim to reduce or prevent its negative effects. These interventions might include tools that help users manage their interaction with AI, such as AI-powered fatigue management apps, mindfulness practices, or workshops teaching time and energy management. These approaches are designed to detect signs of AI fatigue early and provide users with strategies to cope, reducing the likelihood of more serious cognitive or emotional fatigue.
</p>
<p>
Tertiary strategies are aimed at treating the effects of AI fatigue once they have developed, such as providing counseling or offering employee assistance programs (EAPs). While these interventions play an important role in recovery, they focus on addressing the consequences rather than the prevention of AI fatigue. While some argue that organizational-level changes should take priority for addressing the sources of AI fatigue, others believe that empowering individuals with the tools and skills to manage their own fatigue is a more practical and scalable solution. Evidence shows that individual-level interventions can be more directly effective and easier to implement, providing immediate relief and support. This study focuses on secondary strategies, particularly those that enable individuals to manage their own responses to AI fatigue.

Intervention tailoring to individual needs and context is critical for enhancing effectiveness. Many of the most promising technology-delivered interventions are narrow in scope and short in duration, such as 1-minute meditation sessions. These “digital micro-interventions” leverage technology to offer individual components of traditional therapeutic practices, targeting proximal symptoms (e.g., relaxation for fatigue) with the goal of achieving broader outcomes (e.g., preventing burnout). At their best, these systems can use data from user interactions to personalize recommendations, suggesting activities that are most likely to be effective, engaging, preferred, or timely. The most advanced form of such personalization, known as Adaptive Delivery (AD), uses dynamic behavioral data from ubiquitous sensing technologies to tailor interventions in real time.
</p>
<p>
Prior studies have focused on AD in terms of improving the timing of micro-intervention delivery based on ecological momentary assessment (EMA) or other passively collected data. However, no research has yet explored how AD interventions can be integrated into everyday workflows or compared it to a manual, user-controlled approach where the timing of interventions is fully self-managed. While the AD approach shows great potential for improving user engagement and adherence, research into its application in real-world contexts is still in the early stages. This study aims to examine different methods of engaging with digital micro-interventions, focusing on timing and content in work environments. We will assess the effectiveness of various engagement strategies on fatigue management both in the short and long term by measuring user fatigue levels at multiple points throughout the day: immediately before and after intervention use, multiple times a day, and via a weekly self-report survey.
</p>
<p>
As individual needs and behaviors evolve over time, their preferences for engaging with technology-delivered fatigue management interventions—whether initiated by the technology itself or manually triggered—can be influenced by a range of factors, including their context, history, and personal characteristics. An individual's vulnerability to fatigue and perception of its intensity are shaped by relatively stable traits, such as personality, demographics (e.g., age, gender), and past experiences, as well as more dynamic factors that fluctuate over time, including cognitive appraisal abilities, coping strategies, and available social support.
</p>
<p>
The effectiveness and engagement with fatigue management interventions can also be influenced by personal attributes and situational factors, such as the user's current level of fatigue, their receptivity to interventions, and other mediators like acceptance of discomfort or stress. Research has shown that incorporating individual preferences into the design of these interventions can significantly improve both user engagement and outcomes. Our study focuses on understanding user preferences for different types of fatigue management interventions and their optimal timing, aiming to enhance engagement and maximize the long-term impact on reducing workplace fatigue.
</p>
<p>
The goal of this work was to identify design opportunities for systems that integrate digital micro-interventions into everyday work contexts. Our research questions were:
</p>
<p>
RQ-T1: How does intervention timing impact intervention usage, fatigue reduction, and user preference?
RQ-T2: How do different types of interventions impact intervention usage, fatigue reduction, and user preferences?
RQ-T3: What aspects of the intervention timing and content do participants find most useful or needed?
</p>
<p>

To examine the impact of different delivery timings (RQ-T1), we conducted an experimental study comparing two conditions: User-Scheduled (US), where participants chose the timing, and Adaptive Delivery (AD), where the system prompted users based on detected fatigue levels. We designed and developed an intervention system with a chatbot that facilitated the different delivery timings for fatigue management interventions for information workers. In the US condition, the chatbot assisted participants in selecting interventions from a catalog and scheduling them in their calendars; in the AD condition, the chatbot nudged participants to perform interventions when it detected high fatigue levels. </p>
<p>

To examine the impact of different intervention types (RQ-T2), we adapted evidence-based interventions into digital micro-interventions, categorizing them into three types according to their function and required user effort. Participants selected from these three intervention types throughout the study. Finally, to gather user feedback from in-vivo usage of the system (RQ-T3), we deployed the intervention system to 74 information workers and conducted a four-week longitudinal study comparing two delivery timings and three intervention content types. </p>
<p>

We designed and developed an intervention system consisting of three main components: (1) a fatigue score component, (2) an Adaptive Delivery (AD) component, and (3) a chatbot component. Our fatigue score component calculates the user’s current level of fatigue based on passively sensed data. The AD component uses the fatigue scores along with the user’s self-reported fatigue levels to determine when to prompt users to perform fatigue-reduction interventions. Lastly, the chatbot component proactively sends messages to the user, facilitating the delivery of ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), surveys, and intervention content.
